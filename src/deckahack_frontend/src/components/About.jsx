          <h2 className="text-3xl font-semibold text-secondary mb-4">Problem Statement</h2>
          <p className="text-neutral-content">
            The current cryptocurrency ecosystem faces critical challenges such as security vulnerabilities, high fees, and lack of trust in centralized exchanges. Many P2P platforms suffer from inefficiencies, fraud risks, and slow transactions, deterring users from engaging in secure trading. ICPLink addresses these challenges by providing a decentralized solution that enhances security, transparency, and cost-efficiency.

          <h2 className="text-3xl font-semibold text-secondary mb-4">Proposed Solution</h2>
          <p className="text-neutral-content">
            Leveraging ICPâ€™s decentralized architecture and reverse gas model, ICPLink enables cost-effective, secure trading of cryptocurrencies. Users can create and browse ads, communicate in real-time through a ping system, and rely on an escrow service for added security. The platform fosters trust through a reputation system and decentralized identity verification, ensuring a safe and seamless trading experience.
